       <h2 class="product heading" style="margin-right:20px">Japanese Cuisine</h2>
       <p style="margin-right:25px">Japanese cuisine is celebrated for its balanced and health-conscious approach, often incorporating fresh fish, vegetables, rice, and soy products. Sushi and sashimi, rich in lean protein and omega-3 fatty acids from fish, promote heart health. Seaweed, a common ingredient, provides essential vitamins and minerals. Miso soup offers probiotics for gut health, while dishes like tempura and teriyaki are enjoyed in moderation due to their higher fat content. Overall, the emphasis on fresh, natural ingredients and portion control makes Japanese cuisine both delicious and nutritious</p>
